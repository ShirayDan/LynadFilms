It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime."

I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film."

Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.'

'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special."

Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much."

The film is an obvious cash cow but worth the money. No need to put any thought into how stupid this movie its cause it's met to be the opposite of smart. Its entertaining as hell and does not slow down long enough for me to point out the plot holes and the science mistakes. A perfect Tie-in to Shark Week. I went into this baby knowing that I was going to like it and I came out loving every minute of it. It's not met to be Shakespeare but it's definitely a fun experience."

It checked all the boxes for me with the action, racing, and the triumph over adversity. This is definitely worth a watch and was a good change of pace after watching Oppenheimer.'

Following these hate scenes, we get some emotional scenes. Like love for family is everything. And of course some of them are dying to go back to some hate. Diesel is such a bad actor, impossible to accept any of his emotional scenes, be it love or hate. He has not evolved in 20years of filming. There is nothing in between, just primitive emotions for the brainless.'

The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it. A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.'
